# TakeImageFromVideo
This is a very simple program, to take images from a video.
OpenCV need to be configured before using.
Two modes can be chosen to take images:
1. by pressing the keyboard.
2. by input the [interval start end] of the frames.
The path to the video and name of the video should be set in the .txt files.
The program will create a folder with the video's name in the video's path and save the images in that folder.
